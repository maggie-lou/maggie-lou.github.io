title: Over KPI Dashboard
description:
number: 2
modalhead: Especially as startups expand quickly, having a data-driven approach to growth is critical to promote transparency and establish a quantitative baseline for company goals. I created an online dashboard that displays KPIs (key performance indicators, like revenue and retention) and updates daily. 
howto1: Every morning, an R script scrapes data about Overâ€™s KPIs from Amplitude, a data analytics platform that is confusing and difficult to navigate, especially for inexperienced users. 
howto2: The data is fed into a Ruby script that produces an automatically updating dashboard, which includes current data, data from the previous week, and the percent change between the two values.
howto3: The dashboard is available at a password-protected site for all employees. All numbers are displayed as weekly totals for the past seven days since the data was scraped.
